## Introduction

In today's technologically advanced world, energy management is a critical aspect of modern smart homes. Traditional energy meters, while functional, often lack the capability for real-time monitoring and remote access. The advent of IoT (Internet of Things) has revolutionized this space, enabling the creation of smart energy meters that offer precise, real-time monitoring and control. In this article, we present a comprehensive guide to building a Smart IoT Energy Meter using the ESP32 microcontroller, ACS712 current sensor, ZMPT101B voltage sensor, I2C LCD display, Blynk 2.0 platform, and Telegram bot integration.

  - GND to ESP32 GND
  - SDA to ESP32 GPIO 21
  - SCL to ESP32 GPIO 22

## Software Setup

### 1. **Setting Up Blynk 2.0**

#### Creating a Template
1. **Log in to Blynk** and create a new template.
2. Set the **template name**, **hardware type** (ESP32), and other settings.
3. Create **datastreams** for:
   - Voltage (V0)
   - Current (V1)
   - Power (V2)
   - Energy Consumption (V3)
   - Total Cost (V4)

#### Web and Mobile Dashboard
- **Web Dashboard**: Add widgets like Gauges, Displays, etc., and link them to the corresponding datastreams.
- **Mobile Dashboard**: Use the Blynk app to configure similar widgets for real-time monitoring on your smartphone.

### 2. **Creating a Telegram Bot**

1. **Create a Bot** using BotFather in the Telegram app.
2. Save the **Bot Token** and obtain your **Chat ID** using a bot like `@userinfobot`.

### 3. **Programming the ESP32**

#### Libraries Required
- **WiFi.h**: For Wi-Fi connectivity.
- **BlynkSimpleEsp32.h**: For Blynk 2.0 integration.
- **Wire.h**: For I2C communication.
- **LiquidCrystal_I2C.h**: For LCD control.
- **UniversalTelegramBot.h**: For Telegram bot integration.

### 4. **Calculating Energy and Cost**

- **Voltage Measurement**: Convert the analog reading from the ZMPT101B sensor to the actual AC voltage.
- **Current Measurement**: Convert the analog reading from the ACS712 sensor to the actual AC.
- **Power Calculation**: \( \text{Power} = \text{Voltage} \times \text{Current} \)
- **Energy Consumption**: Integrate power over time to find the total energy consumed.
- **Cost Calculation**: Multiply the total energy consumed by the cost per unit of energy.

## Conclusion

This smart IoT energy meter offers a comprehensive solution for monitoring and managing household energy consumption. The integration with Blynk 2.0 provides an intuitive user interface for real-time data visualization, while the Telegram bot adds layer of convenience with automated billing notifications. By leveraging modern IoT technologies, this project helps monitor energy consumption and contributes to energy conservation efforts.

## Future Enhancements
